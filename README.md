# ETHZQuantMethods
Course materials for the demographic structure module (2017 Quantitative Methods at ETH Zurich).

This 3-week module introduces structured population models and explores the unique dynamics that arise when individuals are not demographically identical.

## Key concepts:
- Individual variation
- Population dynamics
- Optimization of life history

## Tools:
- Matrix population models (biology -> model -> analysis)
- Sensitivity analysis
- Differential equations

Instructor: Will Petry

1. Lecture (30-45 min)
    - What is population structure?
    - Mapping life cycles to transition matrices
    - Basic analysis of matrix population models
2. Demonstration of Shiny app
3. Exercises

## 2 May 2017: Sex-structured population models, nonlinearities, and dynamic equilibria
Instructors: Will Petry & Chris Johnson

1. Lecture, part 1 (20 min)
    - Adding multiple structuring variables (sex as a case study)
    - Paradox of two models
2. Exploration of two-sex model Shiny app
3. Analyses of non-linear matrix population models
4. Lecture, part 2
    - Differential equations
    - Oscillations/dynamic equilibria

## 9 May 2017: Environmental sensitivity of demographic rates
